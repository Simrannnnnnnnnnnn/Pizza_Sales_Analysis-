# Descriptive Analytics Project: Summarizing and Describing Pizza Sales for XYZ Company
    
# Introduction
This project aims to analyze and summarize the pizza sales data of XYZ Company using SQL and Power BI. The datasets used in this project is dummy. The objective is to gain insights into various aspects of the company's pizza sales, 

such as:
1. Top-selling pizza categories and sizes
2. Sales trends over time
3. Average order value and quantity
4. Customer preferences and behavior

# Data Sources
The data for this project will be extracted from the company's pizza sales database, which contains information about individual orders, including:

Pizza ID
Order ID
Pizza Name
Quantity
Order Date
Order Time
Unit Price
Total Price
Pizza Size
Pizza Category
Pizza Ingredients

# SQL Data Analysis
Using SQL, I perform the following data analysis tasks:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Identify and handle missing values, data inconsistencies, and outliers to ensure data integrity.

2. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for numerical variables (e.g., quantity, unit price, total price) and frequency distributions for categorical variables (e.g., pizza category, pizza size).

3. Data Aggregation and Summarization: Aggregate data at different levels of granularity (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) to analyze sales trends and patterns.

4. Data Slicing and Dicing: Filter and slice the data based on specific criteria to isolate trends and patterns within specific subgroups (e.g., pizza category, pizza size, location).

# Power BI Data Visualization
Using Power BI, I create interactive visualizations to effectively communicate the insights gained from the SQL analysis. These visualizations may include:

1. Bar charts: To compare sales performance across different categories or dimensions (e.g., pizza category, pizza size).

2. Line charts: To visualize trends and patterns in sales over time (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).

3. Pie charts: To represent the proportion of sales contributed by different categories (e.g., pizza category, pizza size).

4. Scatter charts: To explore relationships between variables (e.g., pizza price vs. quantity sold).

# Expected Outcomes
The project is expected to deliver the following outcomes:

A comprehensive understanding of XYZ Company's pizza sales performance.

Identification of top-selling pizza categories, sizes, and ingredients.

Insights into sales trends over time and customer preferences.

Recommendations for optimizing pizza menu offerings and marketing strategies.

# Project Schedule
The project is estimated to be completed within the following timeline:

Week 1: Data extraction and preparation

Week 2: SQL data analysis and summarization

Week 3: Power BI data visualization
